Personal cheat sheet with Gobuster commands used in CTFs, pentesting, and SOC analysis.

## What is Gobuster?
Gobuster is a tool used for directory and file brute-forcing on web servers. It helps discover hidden directories, files, and DNS subdomains by systematically trying many possible names from a wordlist. This is useful for penetration testing to find resources that are not linked publicly but exist on the server.

### Example 

Website:` http://example.com`

Hidden directory: `/admin`

Usually, if you visit `http://example.com/admin`, you might find an admin panel or some control page that isn't linked publicly on the main site.

Gobuster tries to discover such directories by brute forcing many possible names from a wordlist, for example:
```
gobuster dir -u http://example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```
